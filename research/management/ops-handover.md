# mgmt-ops living state (updated with every digest)

Living state file (LEAD.md "Rules from mgmt-lead iteration 2"): the next mgmt-ops restarts from it (about every 2 h
or at ~60 % context). Charter: `fixes/LEAD.md` "Delegation: mgmt-ops runs the day-to-day". Current instance:
**mgmt-ops-4** (from 08:52Z; mgmt-ops-3 ran 05:04-08:55Z), worktree `.claude/worktrees/mgmt-ops-2` (sparse, on the
snapshot), branch `mgmt-ops/docs-2`. Last update: **09:15Z**.

## How mgmt-ops-3 worked (keep doing this)

- Wait in the foreground with `sh <scratchpad>/mgmt-ops/tick.sh 300` (returns on a lock-holder or incident change; Bash
  timeout 500000). No background monitors. Never end a turn with background work running.
- Messages to agents resume them if they ended; that is fine for GOs. Iphone requests: message `iphone-runner` directly
  for scripted checks (lead OK 07:25Z); finger tests only via the lead. The lead lands, resolves, reorders, spawns.
- Every docs commit: rebase on main, `npm run test:unit`, commit, then a "LAND BATCH" message with the sha(s).
- Quote goal progress as frames > 50 / > 34 ms (Chrome, within ONE hold) and iPhone numbers; > 34 ms varies ±2 across
  holds. Success is judged on the iPhone under a finger first (user decision 08:04Z).

## Digest log (newest first, 5 lines each)

- **09:15Z** Hero block done (P2 /10e small gain; hero v2 kills y≈50 but y≈700 +10 ms WebKit-only, F-035) -> hero bisect
  queued after morph. Morph block partial (phone throttled 09:07, resumes ~09:23): moving p50 ~30 ms, fb n=1 p95 45 vs f
  53-64. de-morph done (5c4fc37): cost = full repaint of resized layers, not blur -> h-fixedpanel ablation (fix-nav-morph)
  joins the morph block. F-034 (freeze served overlays), F-036-039 (de-morph). fix-scroll-engine rebased 272f6c7 + sparse;
  GO /10d prototype (no normal hold before the N10 verdict).

- **09:00Z** (mgmt-ops-4) Lead: 4edb872 npm test 495/495, test:chrome 8/9 (fix-ab test CONTAMINATED by environment,
  topProcs name WindowServer/duetexpertd/zed/iTerm2/claude; accepted as an environmental pass). arch-finger plan landed
  2226d51 (WDA/XCUITest real touches); ts-gesture building gesture.mjs + wda.mjs (measurement code -> reviewer before
  landing); user setup pending. iPhone queue += ts-gesture V0 (~15 min) + V1 (~60 min) after the morph block, when ready.
  10 agents active: goal-metric holds wait for a quieter host or accept requeues (design engineers end in ~1 h).

- **08:55Z** HANDOVER. Snapshot landed (4edb872): all worktrees rebase + `baseline.mjs sparse` between steps; done:
  fix-hero-exit (7169a6a, 9e84199), mgmt-ops-2; HOLDING until their iPhone block ends: fix-nav-morph, fix-scroll-engine
  (iphone-runner serves from them). Base `aw1-10e` (/10e F-030 hotfix landed 60f66b6). Morph: g fixes the jitter, not the
  lag (rendering); scripted driver + mw10e-f/g/fb/gb/ge/gc queued on the phone as #1 after the hero block (B/P/P2/P3).
  Marquee idle check clean. Canary-fps watch still open.

- **08:33Z** Landed: ts-i021 stack 43e40ce (B-E + I-031; canary PASSED, npm test 462/462; I-027, I-031 RESOLVED), I-018.
  Morph root cause (fix-nav-morph): pin target 5312 > maxY 5220 → re-pins every frame against the bounce; candidate
  mw-g-pinclamp-osb waits for the user's finger block (lead). F-030: /10c face will-change churn ~1,500 writes/s at idle in
  the hero → fix-scroll-engine hotfix se10e (lands after parity + short review). hero-exit owns y 0-900 incl. F-032
  people-o. WATCH: canary baseline fps 78 / > 20 ms 57 vs ~92 / ~25 at 04:25Z (n=1, iPhone serving at the time).

- **08:11Z** USER FEEDBACK: no felt difference baseline vs aw1-10c on the iPhone; lag at END (morph pin at y 5220 runs
  10-18 fps under a finger, > 50 ms 50-75/pass) and TOP (hero y 0-900). New order: morph (fix-nav-morph resumed) →
  hero-exit (resumed) → N10. Landed: I-018 d61231e (traced attribution: 5 frames > 34 ms; gtag named; "other" class →
  fix-scroll-engine diagnostic on spare capacity), I-031 reviewed, docs. ts-i021 rebasing B-E + I-031 on I-018 → one
  test:chrome + one canary. npm test ~280 s (watch after B-E). Baseline freeze (ts-snapshot) in progress.

- **07:31Z** iPhone BACK (iphone-runner owns it; I may message it directly for scripted checks, finger tests via lead).
  iPhone goal check baseline → aw1-10c: > 50 ms 5→3, > 34 ms 16→9, fps 52.8→57.1; #1 target ~106 ms at y≈1970 → N10
  (fix-scroll-engine, 4 phone ablations d,c,b,a built d24a656). Chrome: page-owned > 50 ms 0 on aw1-10c, 1 vendor gtag
  frame (user-facing, lead). Landed: Q3 note d33d957 (wave1-dry ENDED), I-030 8bab8b7, docs. N13 CLOSED (0/49). N12 + #6
  land after finger verdict. I-031 opened (other CPU 20-26 % mid-hold) → ts-i021 top-5 process log after D/E.

- **06:32Z** Landed: ts-bench I-028 follow-up 1e2c402 (ts-bench ENDED for good), docs b586b9a + ff00155. N13 forced-toggle
  probe: 0 storms in 2 x 41 toggles → agents-ask visual NOT the trigger (F-027 supersedes F-026); N13 storm-catch hold
  (≤ 24 fresh loads, traced/untraced alternating) queued #2. N12 A/B `--on aw1-10c` starting 06:31 (waited 14 min: I-030,
  shorts pass a normal whose gate isn't settled; ts-i021 after I-027; workaround: no new shorts while a goal normal is #1).
  Bench pilot: tool OK (styleWrite Proxy counts), VACUOUS/FAIL rows are spec choices. Lead caffeinate until ~08:36Z.

- **06:16Z** Landed: /10c 8f9ebe5 (review-10c ACCEPT-WITH-NOTES; counts "> 50 ms 2 → 1 in the measured window, load-time
  cost bounded by mech probe, iPhone pending"), docs 1b8aeac + cc09344. Wave-2 base `aw1-10c` (hashes confirmed). E3 →
  F-026 storm → N13 (fix-scroll-engine, forced-toggle probe, before /10d). Part 4 done (diagnostic). I-018 NEEDS-WORK →
  CDP metrics opt-in, validation = one traced run + test:chrome. 05:56Z contamination = ts-i017 e2e outside the lock
  (rule now in CLAUDE.md). wave1-dry: pilot-only spec (B) + Q3-final requeue.

- **05:58Z** Landed: N11 fea23a5 (mechanism only), docs 7542538, I-028+I-029 4f5667d (ts-bench ENDED; review-i028
  ACCEPT-WITH-NOTES → one ts-bench follow-up commit, tracked in I-028 notes). /10c hold 05:39-05:46: > 50 ms 2→1 BETTER,
  > 34 ms 4→3 noise, F-011 gone 5/5, p95 +0.8 ms WORSE flag; review-10c on a7b95d1, lead lands on ACCEPT. Lead started the
  I-018 gate early (ts-i017 rebasing f71ee42 → reviewer → A/A on/off hold ahead of q3). Starvation note: shorts drained
  ahead of /10c ~13 min → ping lead when a goal-path normal waits > 10 min (mgmt-lead iteration 3 item).

- **05:17Z** (mgmt-ops-3) Lead: npm test 0e8f288 414/414; test:chrome 7/8, bench.chrome FAIL → I-028 (ts-bench, styleWrite
  probe vacuous). GO sent: ts-i021 (I-027 + I-026 reopen; no file overlap with I-028), wave1-dry (Q3 only; bench pilot held
  until I-028), fix-scroll-engine (/10c `--on all-wave1`). N11 hold 05:05-05:15: clean (0/10), goal metrics FLAT
  (> 50 ms 2→2, > 34 ms 3→4); waiting on owner phases.mjs readout before land/no-land. q3 took the lock 05:16 ahead of
  scroll-engine (normal ≤ 10 min). kpi friction: no alarms; warns IPHONE-PARKED/STALE, STRAY-CHROME (MCP Chrome 10.9 h).

- **05:02Z** GOAL HOLD done (all-wave1 42f4033 → main 0e8f288, F-022): > 50 ms 3→2, > 34 ms 5→5 within noise; fps
  93.8→110.6 hint; left > 50 ms = gtag (N11) + F-011 render frame (/10c). ts-bench batch landed (bench on main),
  ts-bench ENDED; lead's npm test + test:chrome on 0e8f288 running → then GO ts-i021 I-027. Wave 2: N11 queued (normal,
  GO given) → /10c → I-018 (f71ee42 review + A/A cdp-metrics on/off + test:chrome) → N12 → hero-exit → countdown 05/08
  → E4 (folded into attribution). DIRECTION updated (mgmt-ops/docs-2). apple-verify hold 5 done (report pending).

- **04:25Z** Landed: I-023/I-024A 48ace89+772e675+85fdeac, I-026 93b4af2 (holds keep the Mac awake), cap docs b93ec5f (npm
  test + commit lease 300 s). Canary PASSED on 93b4af2 (A/A runs 1 clean, test:chrome 7/7); I-017/22/23/24 RESOLVED,
  I-016 parked (e4 user/hooks, f P3). GO sent to wave1-dry 04:2xZ (goal hold, --max-seconds 1200). NEW floor: canary
  baseline fps 92, > 50 ms 4, > 34 ms 5 (vs ~75 fps pre-gate): never compare to old baselines. Mac slept 04:04-04:20Z
  with the lock free (I-026 gap → reopen note: assertion while anyone is QUEUED; lead caffeinate 4 h again; user asked
  about `pmset -c sleep 0`). Next: apple-verify ~4 min hold → N11 → /10c → N12; ts-bench rebase (lead) after the hold.

- **03:43Z** I-023 chain: 48ace89 (review NEEDS-WORK) + 772e675 fixup (review ACCEPT) + a 3rd commit (verify installs its own
  SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP handlers; re-entered holds had none and left Chrome running) committing now; test:chrome after it
  (772e675 was 6/7). Lead lands all 3 when 7/7, review-i023 re-checks the 3rd (1 file), then I-026 rebase, canary
  (`ab --aa --runs 1` + test:chrome), bench rebase (fake-chrome.mjs; review-bench ACCEPT-WITH-NOTES), then GO wave1-dry.
  Wave 2 ready: N11 (parity incl. pagehide flush), N12 v4 (parity 0/5, "20-34 ms band only"), scroll-engine /10c in mech-c.

- **02:55Z** Landed: I-021 0f29e7b+d10b132 (RESOLVED), I-020 4b1034e (RESOLVED), I-024B e7ce0e4, CLAUDE.md lock
  rules 10f7bee, N3 docs 6a0db1a, handover b579b78. I-027 (P2, ts-i021, after I-024A) opened. ts-i017 I-023/I-024A ETA
  ~03:35Z + queue (02:37Z probe: idle Chrome survives 80 s; sleep explains 1953 s). scroll-engine mech10: 339 ms LoAF
  in /10 only + layers 304->741 (re-run). N12 v2: nav reads ~0, parity desktop 24/168 (v3). N11: flush edge re-probe.
- **02:46Z** no change; ts-i017 moved to #1 by lead (02:37Z).

- **02:34Z** I-023/I-024A (P0, ts-i017) no sha; ts-i017 not queued yet (lead moves it to #1 on queue). No ALARM,
  host QUIET. NEW I-026 (env): Mac Maintenance Sleep/DarkWake during holds stalls timers (explains 933-940 s
  verify-fake); rec caffeinate/pmset = user. Land: mgmt-ops docs 6a0db1a (N3 rejected). User: I-026, Spotlight,
  FW_TOOLING hook, iPhone.
- **01:40Z** first digest after restart; incident candidate (hook npm test under load) became I-024 (lead).

## Next actions for the next mgmt-ops (in order)

1. iphone-runner (owns the phone; every block starts with a passing control: fails if bottom/idle < 58 fps or baseline
   scroll < 44 fps). Its queue:
   (a) HERO block: DONE 09:08Z (results in DIRECTION; routed to fix-hero-exit). fix-scroll-engine rebased after it.
   (b) MORPH driver block (#1 priority): mw10e-f vs g (overscroll-behavior question), f vs fb, g vs gb, g vs ge, g vs gc,
       n=3 each; `window.__fwMorphDrive({hold:2000,cycles:3})`, poll `window.__fwMD`; serve from fix-nav-morph's worktree
       `node tools/fix.mjs serve <build> --on aw1-10e`.
   (c) N12 block: aw1-10c vs n12v5-aw1 (matched pair, fix-nav-morph's worktree); hero window esp. y≈700 (F-029 nav ee()
       forced style), middle, end, parity spots. If y≈700 goes → N12 enters the base (needs a review then).
   (b1) + `h-fixedpanel` (fix-nav-morph builds it on aw1-10e, lead 09:12Z): queue it in the morph block next to
       b-noblur as soon as fix-nav-morph sends label/URL; prediction (de-morph) h beats b by 20-35 ms per moving frame.
   (b3) HERO BISECT (sent 09:13Z): v4nocards (CSS c9a4d089), v5noblur (CSS 005c825d) vs P frozen (JS 71d76d69 / CSS
       8a14ac2e), P2 second ref, v3 (808e25a1) optional; y≈50 / y≈700 frames; fix-hero-exit 08be84c waits for it.
   (b2) ts-gesture V0 smoke (~15 min) + V1 validation (~60 min), `research/architecture/finger-simulation.md` §5c, only
       when ts-gesture reports its phone part ready (and the user's one-time setup is done); else skip to (c).
   (d) N10 ablations, rebuilt on aw1-10e (0e62ccc; base `.../agent-a1722cf5058e25591/fixes/aw1-10e/overlay`; order
       d, c, b, a; R3 logger); sent to iphone-runner 08:57Z.
   After each block ends: tell the owners whose worktree it served from that they may now rebase + sparse.
2. Results routing: hero → fix-hero-exit (then ONE Chrome A/B `--on aw1-10e` ≤ 10 min, > 50/> 34 in the hero window);
   morph → fix-nav-morph (if b names the blur → N2 composited morph: fixed radii faded by opacity; the driver hook must be
   stripped before landing; the pin-fix land patch is variants/g-pinclamp-osb.diff). N12 + #6 v05 land after the user's
   finger verdict (C/D postponed until a morph render fix exists).
3. WATCH (lead 08:31Z): canary A/A on 43e40ce fps 78.3 / > 20 ms 57 / p95 25 vs ~92 / ~25 at 04:25Z on 93b4af2. If the next
   goal-hold A/A also shows ~78 fps → incident + A/A 93b4af2 vs 43e40ce in one hold.
4. Caffeinate: the lead's current one runs to ~10:19Z → remind the lead at ~10:10Z (restart every 2 h until the user sets
   pmset).
5. arch-finger researches OS-level touch simulation on the iPhone (WDA/XCUITest, safaridriver, simulator): its plan comes
   via the lead; when it exists, morph/touch checks become scriptable.
6. Backlog for mgmt-lead iteration 3 (none urgent): recheck pauses instead of contaminating; gate.since survives intervening
   holds; WindowServer counted as measured system in the gate (I-031 answer: steady other CPU 17-20 % = WindowServer +
   agent CLIs + iTerm; daemons tip it over 25 %); fewer concurrent agents during goal holds; verify has no measured load
   phase; iphone wip.mjs stub clock; kpi rule on topProcs; trace buffer 300 → 32 MB + opt-in V8 categories; review-10e
   note (a) JS comment 1,500 → 1,915/s.

## Where the project stands (08:55Z)

- main = 4edb872 (snapshot) on the wave-2 base `aw1-10e` = all-wave1 + scroll-engine /10e. Chrome: page-owned > 50 ms
  frames 0; 1 vendor frame per run (gtag `onscrollend`, removable only by the site's GA "Scrolls" setting; user-facing,
  lead). I-018 attribution: remaining > 34 ms classes = gtag, nav `ee()` forced style (N12 v5 fixes), a 429-element
  restyle at +1.1 s, paint.
- iPhone (scripted, aw1-10c): > 50 ms 5→3, > 34 ms 16→9; user feels NO difference. Felt lag: morph pin (10-18 fps, render
  cost, three per-frame blur radii suspected) and the hero window (y≈50 frame, F-032 people-o reflow).
- Closed today: N11 (mechanism only, vendor), N13 (rare, not reproducible), I-018, I-026-I-031, I-028/029.

## Incidents (08:55Z; see `incident.mjs list`)

| id | state | owner | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-016 | parked | lead | e4 hooks via short lane (user), f orphans P3 |
| – | all others resolved today (I-018, I-026 … I-031) | – | follow-ups are in the backlog line above |

## Who waits on what (08:55Z)

| agent | state | waits on | next |
|---|---|---|---|
| iphone-runner | owns the phone; hero block (B/P/P2/P3) | – | morph driver block → N12 → N10 |
| fix-nav-morph | morph owner (#1); driver + mw10e-* builds 4732f6c; holds rebase/sparse until morph AND N12 blocks end; building h-fixedpanel (lead) | morph driver block results | h vs b decide → R1 size-stable panel or N2/R7 |
| fix-hero-exit | hero window owner (#2); 08be84c (rebased + sparse) | hero bisect results (I forward) | real fix (new name) → phone → one Chrome A/B `--on aw1-10e` |
| fix-scroll-engine | N10 (#3); rebased 272f6c7 + sparse; N10 overlays frozen (aw1-10e 3e2f599a, d 7de8ee9a) | phone (last in queue) | building /10d prototype (se10d-aw1) parity + idle probe only |
| ts-snapshot | delivered; follow-ups from review-snapshot (lead) | – | – |
| arch-finger | plan landed 2226d51 (finger-simulation.md) | – | – |
| ts-gesture | toolsmith: gesture.mjs + wda.mjs vs a fake WDA | user's one-time setup (Xcode, Developer Mode, UI Automation) | reviewer, then V0/V1 on the phone (queue b2) |
| de-morph, de-hero, de-middle | design-engineering (read-only, report to the lead) | – | proposals routed to owners; end in ~1 h |
| ts-i017, ts-i021, ts-bench, wave1-dry, N11, apple-verify | ENDED | – | do not resume without the lead |

## Priority order (user feedback 08:04Z; DIRECTION "Priority from user feedback")

(1) morph on WebKit (fix-nav-morph) → (2) hero window y 0-900 (fix-hero-exit) → (3) N10 y≈1970 (fix-scroll-engine) →
/10d → countdown 05/08. Chrome-only 20-50 ms work on spare capacity. New variants `--on aw1-10e`; normal holds ≤ 10 min.

## Queue rules and monitors

- Shorts: ONE 300 s lease for commit + hook, gate open; `--timeout 14400` on every `lock.mjs run`/`acquire` wait.
- I-030 landed: shorts never pass a lead-moved normal and pass any gated normal only in its first 120 s. Still ping the
  lead when a goal-path normal waits > 10 min. Quick shorts ≤ ~90 s while a goal normal is #1 are accepted.
- Outside a lock slot: unit test files only (CLAUDE.md); no builds (combine, npx) while a normal holds chrome-measure.
- HOLDER-IDLE > 5 min with 3+ waiting → lead IMMEDIATELY. Friction scan (`node research/management/tools/kpi.mjs
  --friction`) at check-ins; ALARM in 2 consecutive check-ins → incident candidate.
- No Monitors armed. Use the foreground `tick.sh` (scratchpad `mgmt-ops/`); it points at the mgmt-ops-2 worktree.
- Measurement-code canary: any verify/cdp/fix-ab change lands only after `ab --aa --runs 1` on main + test:chrome.
- Reviewer checklist (LEAD.md §4, F-030): topics adding observers/listeners/attribute writes get an idle-counts probe at
  y=0 before landing.

## Open user-facing questions (lead holds them)

Chrome vendor residual (gtag `onscrollend`, site GA "Scrolls" setting); pmset sleep setting (caffeinate stopgap); finger
tests (C/D #6 postponed until a morph render fix exists); arch-finger's touch-simulation plan.
